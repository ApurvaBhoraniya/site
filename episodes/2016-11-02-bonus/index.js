    [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) bills itself as fast, reliable, and secure dependency management. It was [recently released](https://code.facebook.com/posts/1840075619545360) as a collaborative effort with developers from Facebook, Google, and Tilde. In this bonus show, we're going to talk about what this means for the JavaScript community.
