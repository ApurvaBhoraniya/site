  description: `
    The JavaScript community is composed of a ton of people with a ton of different backgrounds and privilege. We need to do our very best to make everyone feel as included as possible. It makes everything better when we work to foster a welcoming and friendly community. We&#x27;re going to talk about what you can do to improve inclusiveness in your workspace and community.
