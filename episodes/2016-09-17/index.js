    **NOTE**: We had a fantastic show this week at The Strange Loop! But Kent made a mistake by not setting my computer to use the microphone interface for the audio and so the sound is just using the MacBook's built-in microphone, which resulted in really terrible audio quality. Really sorry about this! On the audio feed, there is a rerun of one of the more popular shows that is relevant to the type of conversations you would hear at The Strange Loop.

    **Original Description:** We're going to be chatting with the wonderful and intelligent people at The Strange Loop Conference!
