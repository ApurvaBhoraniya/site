    The average npm project has [100](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/146943134240/npm-add-ons) dependencies and subdependencies. Managing these dependencies can be challenging. We're going to talk about [DependencyCI](https://dependencyci.com/) and [Libraries.io](https://libraries.io/), and with the great person behind [Greenkeeper.io](https://greenkeeper.io/) about how to make managing these dependencies easier.
